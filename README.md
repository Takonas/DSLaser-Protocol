# Hey Tasnuva!

I wrote up this git repo just to knock out everything all at once so I didn't have to worry about it later on in the semester.

## For giving the Assignment

### Resources to be distributed

The following should be distributed to the students:
RFC - Assignment 2.pdf
Assignment 2.pdf
The deathstarserver.exe

### In-class announcement

I'll probably need to give a 15-20 minute brief/introduction to the assignment so everyone understands what I'm asking. While I feel confident in the concise manner I expressed my instructions of this assignment, it would likely help if I give a quick in-class talk just so nothing is lost in translation.

Just let me know when you want me to give that introduction, and I'll make sure I'm present that day.

## Regarding the Client/Server Folders

I've included both the Python files (client and server) and their converted exes with dynamic imports included. While the deathstarserver.exe is the only file of the client/server files that I wish to distribute to the students, I've included all of them to allow you to test its behavior.

## For Editing

I'm giving you total ability to edit the repo, if you wish to make any edits.

## For Testing

I've left a Professors Notes of the expected behavior that's meant to be clear on the expected behavior of the system.
