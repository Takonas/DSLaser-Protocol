# Overview

This was a mini-CTF designed for the Fall Semester of CSC 4501 Networking for LSU as their 2nd Homework assignment. Its made to emulate a PLC in a live environment with the server capable of being hosted on a Virtual Image with the students attempting to communicate to the server based off the information provided to get the flag. 

## Resources to be distributed

The following should be distributed to the students:
\RFC - Assignment 2.pdf
\Assignment 2.pdf
\The deathstarserver.exe

## Regarding the Client/Server Folders

I've included both the Python files (client and server) and their converted exes with dynamic imports included. While the deathstarserver.exe is the only file of the client/server files that I wish to distribute to the students, I've included all of them to allow testing of its behavior.

## For Testing

I've left a Professors Notes of the expected behavior that's meant to be clear on the expected behavior of the system.
